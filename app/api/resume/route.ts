 * Resumes a paused triage with the human approve/reject decision. With the

 * later, possibly on a different serverless instance. With the in-memory
 * fallback it only works while the process that paused is still alive; the UI
 * surfaces which mode is active so a failed resume is explicable, not mysterious.
 *
 * This is the ONLY path that lets commit_roadmap run. The write is gated on this
 * human decision, not on anything the model produced — the structural half of
 * the lethal-trifecta containment.
